Description: This package can take in a phylogeny or a genetic sequence alignment 
  using ape's implementation of these objects and group individual sequences into 
  clusters based on a tree or graph built from their relationships. Given some 
  specification of "New" sequences, cluster growth can be defined as new sequences
  joining old clusters. Growth as an outcome can be then be fit to a model and the performance of this model can be used to judge optimal clusters.
