Description: This package can take identify clusters from the ape package's 
  implementation of tree and sequence data. Multiple common definitions of sequence
  based clusters are implemented as functions, with a cluster neatly standardized 
  as a row in a data.table object. This also offers some ability to run and test 
  predictive models on clustered data sets, tracking the effect of known variables 
  within clusters (ex. time) on outcomes such as cluster growth over time. Several
  built in functions handle the measurement and definition of cluster growth for
  this purpose. Optimal clusters(built under a certain set of parameters) can be
  identified based on predictive model performance.
