# PhydingClusters (name pending)
Implementing phylogenetic clustering algorithms and finding their optimal parameters through predictive growth modelling.

This package takes in genetic data and sorts it into descrete clusters using one of multiple different clustering algorithms. Sequence data can be extended to a graph structure based on pairwise distance measurements and inputted trees can be extended to include several annotations useful for cluster assignment.
Cluster growth is also considered through the specification of "New" sequences, which can represent cluster growth as they join known clusters.
